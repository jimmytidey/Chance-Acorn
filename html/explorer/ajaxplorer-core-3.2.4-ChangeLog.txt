AjaXplorer 3.2.4 includes a large amount of bug fixes, plus some minor but interesting features : open any file type with any « editor » plugin or in a new browser window (integration to the core of the hook.openfile plugin), various Css3 tweaking for a better looking ( I hope you’ll like it! ), and a better support of streaming (http-range) that should also impact on resumable downloads. The last ones being part of a more generic amelioration for supporting the brand new AjaXplorer iOS client!
